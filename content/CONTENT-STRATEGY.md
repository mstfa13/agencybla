### FAQ Structure (Accordion Style)

**Category 1: General Questions**

**Q1: What services do you offer?**
**A:** "We provide a full range of digital services including web development, mobile app development, IT consulting, cloud services, cybersecurity, graphic design, and video production. Think of us as your one-stop shop for all digital needs."

**Q4: What are your payment terms?**
**A:** "We typically work with milestone-based payments: 30% upfront, 40% at mid-project, and 30% upon completion. Custom payment plans are available for larger projects."

**Q5: Do you offer post-launch support?**
**A:** "Yes! All projects include a support period (duration varies by project type). We also offer ongoing maintenance packages for long-term support."

---

**Category 2: Web Development**

**Q1: Can I update my website myself after it's built?**
**A:** "Absolutely! We build most websites on content management systems (CMS) like WordPress or Webflow, which allow you to easily update text, images, and other content without coding knowledge. We provide training and documentation."

**Q2: Do you provide web hosting?**
**A:** "We can recommend and set up hosting for you with trusted providers (SiteGround, AWS, etc.), or work with your existing hosting. Hosting costs are separate from development fees."

**Q3: Will my website work on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)?**
**A:** "Yes! All our websites are built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring they look and perform great on all screen sizes and devices."

**Q4: How much does a website cost?**
**A:** "Website costs vary based on complexity, features, and design requirements. Simple sites start around 15,000 EGP, while complex e-commerce or custom web apps can range from 50,000 to 300,000+ EGP. Contact us for a custom quote."

**Q5: Can you redesign my existing website?**
**A:** "Yes! We offer website redesign services to modernize outdated sites, improve performance, and enhance user experience."

---

**Category 3: Mobile Apps**

**Q1: Should I build a native or cross-platform app?**
**A:** "It depends on your goals and budget. Native apps (separate iOS and Android) offer the best performance but cost more. Cross-platform apps (Flutter, React Native) are more affordable and faster to build, with near-native performance. We'll help you choose the best approach."

**Q2: Do you help with app store submission?**
**A:** "Yes! We handle the entire submission process for both Apple App Store and Google Play Store, including creating store listings, screenshots, and descriptions."

**Q3: What's the cost of maintaining an app after launch?**
**A:** "Ongoing maintenance depends on complexity but typically ranges from 10-20% of the initial development cost per year. This includes bug fixes, OS updates, and minor feature additions."

**Q4: Can you integrate my app with existing systems (e.g., CRM, ERP)?**
**A:** "Yes! We specialize in API integration and can connect your app to virtually any existing system or third-party service."

---

**Category 4: IT & Cloud Services**

**Q1: Is cloud more secure than on-premise servers?**
**A:** "When properly configured, cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) is often more secure than on-premise solutions, with enterprise-grade security, automatic backups, and compliance certifications. We ensure best practices during migration."

**Q2: What cloud platform do you recommend?**
**A:** "It depends on your specific needs, but we typically recommend AWS (most versatile), Microsoft Azure (best for Windows/Office integration), or Google Cloud (best for data analytics). We'll assess your requirements and recommend the best fit."

**Q3: How long does cloud migration take?**
**A:** "Simple migrations can take 2-4 weeks, while complex enterprise migrations may take 2-3 months. We create a detailed migration plan to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth transition."

**Q4: What's included in a cybersecurity audit?**
**A:** "Our audits include vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, security policy review, compliance assessment (GDPR, ISO), and a detailed report with actionable recommendations."

---

**Category 5: Design & Video**

**Q1: How many design revisions are included?**
**A:** "Most design projects include 2-3 rounds of revisions. For logo design, we provide 3 initial concepts, then refine your chosen direction. Additional revisions beyond the included rounds can be added for a small fee."

**Q2: What file formats will I receive?**
**A:** "You'll receive source files (AI, PSD, or Figma) plus high-resolution exports in common formats (PNG, PDF, JPG, SVG). For video, you'll get final renders in MP4 and original project files if requested."

**Q3: Can you match my existing brand guidelines?**
**A:** "Yes! If you have brand guidelines, we'll ensure all design work aligns perfectly. If you don't have guidelines yet, we can create them as part of a branding package."

**Q4: How long does video production take?**
**A:** "A simple video (e.g., social media ad) can be done in 1-2 weeks. More complex projects like corporate videos or animations may take 3-4 weeks, depending on length and complexity."

## ✍️ WRITING STYLE GUIDE

### Tone & Voice

**Professional but Approachable:**
- Use "we" and "you" (conversational)
- Avoid jargon unless necessary (and explain when used)
- Be confident but not arrogant
- Show empathy for client pain points

**Example (Good):**
"We know choosing the right web development partner can be overwhelming. That's why we focus on clear communication and transparent pricing—no surprises, just results."

**Example (Too Formal/Bad):**
"The selection of an appropriate digital solutions provider necessitates comprehensive evaluation of multiple variables including but not limited to technical proficiency and fiscal transparency."

---

### Language Guidelines

**For English Content:**
- **Spelling:** Use British English (colour, optimise, centre) as it's more common in Egypt
- **Numbers:** Use commas for thousands (e.g., "10,000 EGP")
- **Dates:** Use "5 November 2025" or "Nov 5, 2025" (not 11/5/2025)

**For Arabic Content (If Bilingual):**
- Use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) for professionalism
- Consider Egyptian Colloquial Arabic for social media/casual content
- Ensure proper RTL formatting
- Use Arabic numerals (١٢٣) or Western numerals (123) consistently

---

### SEO Best Practices

**Image Alt Text:**

### Call-to-Action (CTA) Guidelines

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Get Free Consultation →"
- ✅ "Start Your Project Today"
- ✅ "Download Our Free Guide"
- ❌ "Click Here"
- ❌ "Submit"
- ❌ "Learn More" (overused, be more specific)
